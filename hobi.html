      <h2>Hobi</h2>
      <p>
        Engaging in the world of data science has become my passionate
        hobby,where I immerse myself in the vast sea of information and uncover
        hiddenpatterns. Exploring datasets and applying various algorithms not
        only captivates my analytical mind but also allows me to derive
        meaningful insights. The thrill of discovering correlations and making
        predictions fuels my curiosity and keeps me on the cutting edge of
        technological advancements. Beyond the realm of data, I find solace and
        balance in a diverse set of hobbies. Pencak Silat, a traditional martial
        art, instills discipline and sharpens my focus, providing a physical
        counterpart to the mental challenges of data science. Futsal serves as a
        dynamic outlet for team collaboration and fitness, a refreshing break
        from the screen-based world of coding and analysis. Additionally, my
        love for playing musical instruments, whether it's strumming the guitar
        or creating melodies on the piano, offers a creative escape, allowing me
        to express myself in a different dimension. These eclectic hobbies weave
        together, creating a tapestry that enhances both my analytical and
        holistic well-being.
